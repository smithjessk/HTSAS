Not much to take notes on for this lecture; Paul Graham put it all in an essay that is posted [here](http://www.paulgraham.com/before.html). 

Mostly, he really wants to ingrain how hard it is to be an entrepreneur. He also gives some good general advice about products and teams, and there is a great Q+A at the end.
