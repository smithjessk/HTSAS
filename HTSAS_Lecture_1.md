***Sam Altman***

- Success = (idea) * (product) * (team) * (experience) * (luck)
- Luck is very random, very important; however, you can still set yourself up for success by doing well in other 4 categories
- Don't start a startup just to do it or to get rich

### The Idea ###
 - Some think ideas aren't that important, but they are more important than pivots
 - **Idea comes first, startup comes second; multiple ideas -> choose the one you can't stop thinking about**
 - Must be exciting for 10 years (average time for a startup to be successful) 
 - Derivative companies don't excite employees or investors 
 - Idea includes growth + size of market, defensibility strategy 
 - Idea should target a unique market and often seems bad at first - Best founders are passionate about their ideas and their ideas are actually useful to them
 - Unique/niche markets are also usually pretty desperate for a solution 
 - Answer the question "Why now?" for your company
 - Good ideas can be explained in a sentence

### As a Student ###
- Think about new ideas
- Meet potential cofounders
- Always think about the market first (demand then supply)

### The Product ###
- Includes customer support and copyright explaining the product
- Until you build a great product, nothing else matters
- At the beginning, almost all of your time should be spent talking to customers or working on the product- money and press come later; Ignore partnerships, etc.
- Build something users love; Talk to users
- Much easier to expand from small number of dedicated users than from large number of lukewarm users
- Organic growth by word-of-mouth is the secret to longterm growth 
- Very few startups die from competition; Most die because they don't build something users love
- Start with as simple (straightforward) of a product as possible
- Takes some level of fanaticism to build a great product
- Early on, don't buy Google ads; Find users by hand, they will give you feedback
- Paul Graham's essay on things that don't scale
- Have as tight of a feedback loop as is possible, especially in the early days
- Great founders often do the sales + customer support themselves
- Metrics: Ignore total registrations, look at activity, cohort retention, revenue

### Life of a Founder ###
- Entrepreneurship isn't as glamorous as its made out to be
- You're always on call, you're a role model, you're always working anyway
- Unwanted media attention
- More committed (less option value)
- Number one rule of being a founder is managing your own psychology 
- According to CEO of Evernote, founders have the most bosses (e.g. users, media, employees)
- "Who do I disappoint the least?"
- Don't start a company for the money; Much easier to make money taking a job at a large company
- Large companies can provide impact because they have existing userbases and infrastructure 

### Good Reasons to Start a Company ###
- You can't not do it 
- The world needs you to do it
